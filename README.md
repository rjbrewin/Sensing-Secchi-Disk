This GitHub repository accompanies the manuscript of Brewin et al. titled “Lab on a Secchi disk: A prototype open-source profiling package for low-cost monitoring in aquatic environments”. It includes all the files and information needed to build, test and operate a Sensing Secchi Disk (SSD). It also includes a Jupyter notebook (Notebook_SSD_example.ipynb) designed to illustrate how to read the data collected from a SSD. Click on the image below to launch it.
