# Sensing-Secchi-Disk

This GitHub repository accompanies the manuscript of Brewin et al. titled “Lab on a Secchi disk: A prototype opensource profiling package for low-cost monitoring in aquatic environments”. 

Subject to publication, this will include all the files and information needed to build, test and run a Sensing Secchi Disk (SSD). It will also include a Jupyter notebook (Notebook_SSD_example.ipynb) designed to illustrate how to process the data collected from a SSD.
